   ❌ Avoid links with extra parameters:  
   https://bato.si/title/125589-the-fragrant-flower-blooms-with-dignity-official-simulpub?start=1#chapters

2. **Select a save location** (folder path).

3. **Choose save options**:
- `Save to folder`
- `Save to archive`
- `Save with pictures`

⚠ At least **one storage option** must be selected:

And at least **one file format** must be selected:  
- **Pictures** or **PSD**
